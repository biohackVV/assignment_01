A core construct in R is the __R package__, a structure that provides an organized mechanism through which to develop and disseminate code that you produce. R packages range widely in both scope and function -- you've already seen that some provide incredible new functionality (e.g., `ggpot2`'s implementation of the Grammar of Graphics), but not all packages need to be so complex. In this exercise, we will examine some principles of R package development and write a small package to practice what we've learned."
